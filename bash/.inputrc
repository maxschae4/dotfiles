# Make Tab autocomplete regardless of filename case
set completion-ignore-case on
# Make tab autocomplete - and _ interchangeably
set completion-map-case on
# Make tab autocomplete hidden (dotfiles)
set match-hidden-files on
# List all matches in case multiple possible completions are possible
set show-all-if-ambiguous on
# Immediately add a trailing slash when autocompleting symlinks to directories
set mark-symlinked-directories on
# If there are more than 200 possible completions for a word, ask to show them all
set completion-query-items 200
# Show extra file information when completing, like `ls -F` does
set visible-stats on
# Colorize tab-completion like ls does
set colored-states on
# Be more intelligent when autocompleting by also looking at the text after
# the cursor. For example, when the current line is "cd ~/src/mozil", and
# the cursor is on the "z", pressing Tab will not autocomplete it to "cd
# ~/src/mozillail", but to "cd ~/src/mozilla". (This is supported by the
# Readline used by Bash 4.)

# Allow UTF-8 input and output, instead of showing stuff like $'\0123\0456'

# Flip through autocompletion matches with Shift-Tab.
